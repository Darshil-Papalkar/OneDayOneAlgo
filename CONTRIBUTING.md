Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase üíØ (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests: üë®‚Äçüíª
1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/briandk/transcriptase-atom/issues)

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have üî•:

  - Give sample code if you can. 
- What you expected would happen  
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
