# Problem 8

In the given  one-thousand digit number we are required to find the largest product of 13 adjacent digits.

The approach to solve this problem is to first convert this number to a string.
Then we will find the largest possible product of 13 adjacent digits by looping over the string.

We will code the solution in python.
